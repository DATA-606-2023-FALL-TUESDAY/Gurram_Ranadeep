## Background
Vehicle emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are a significant factor in climate change.Governments and organizations from all over the world are supporting the adoption of cleaner automobiles in an effort to cut emissions. Giving consumers information on how their car choices will affect the environment is one strategy to promote the use of cleaner automobiles. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning-based system that can forecast a vehicles CO2 emissions based on its attributes. A dataset of vehicle characteristics, including cylinder count, transmission type, fuel type, and fuel consumption in city, highway, and combination situations, will be used to train the system. The projects objective is to create a system that can precisely forecast CO2 emissions for new cars, assisting consumers.


**Research Questions**
 - Determine or put to the test how various factors affect CO2 emission?
 - What are the most influencing features that affect the CO2 emission the most?
 - When considering the fuel consumption for city and highway separately as well as the weighted variable interaction 
   between the two,    will the CO2 emissions differ in any way?



## Data 

**Describe the datasets you are using to answer your research questions.**

- Data size: 90 kB
- Data shape: # Number of rows - 6282 and # Number of  columns - 12

**What features are important, what column means what**
1.Make: Company of the vehicle.
2.Model: Car model.
3.Vehicle Class: A classification of vehicles based on their weight, utility, and capacity.
4.Engine Size: Engine Size (in Litres).
5.Cylinders: Number of cylinders.
6.Transmission: Transmission type with number of gears.
7.Fuel Type: Type of Fuel used.
8.Fuel Consumption City: Fuel used on city roads per 100 km.
9.Fuel Consumption Hwy: Fuel consumption in Hwy roads (L/100 km).
10.Fuel Consumption Comb: The combined fuel consumption (45% on the highway and 55% in the cities) is displayed in L/100 km.
11.Fuel Consumption Comb mpg: The combined fuel consumption in both city and highway is shown in mile per gallon(mpg)
