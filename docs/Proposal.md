## Background
This dataset offers a thorough look at reported crimes in different British boroughs, making it a useful tool for in-depth investigation. Major categories in the dataset, including "Burglary," "Violence Against the Person," "Robbery," "Criminal Damage," and "Theft and Handling," enable us to analyze crime patterns in an efficient manner.
We may first determine the most common sorts of crimes by looking at the distribution of reported crimes by major category. Policymakers and law enforcement organizations can better allocate resources with the use of this information.
In the end, this thorough analysis equips users with data-driven insights to make wise judgments, create efficient policies, and efficiently direct resources to address crime-related concerns in the varied boroughs of the United Kingdom.


**Research Questions**
1.Are there any observable trends or patterns in the way that total crime rates changed over time?
2.Are there any months when certain crimes tend to happen more frequently than others?
3.Are there seasonal variations in crime rates, and if so, what might explain these fluctuations?
4.Can we create a prediction model based on historical data to anticipate future crime rates?
5.Do certain main crime categories frequently co-occur in the same neighborhoods or seasons?
6.Are there any statistical anomalies or outliers that stand out, such as months or boroughs with very high or low crime rates?
